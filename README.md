# Abide : Rule Contribution Repository

The [**abide** verification framework](https://github.com/samarion/scala-abide) is built in an extensible way that enables
simple user-defined rule addition. To provide a high(er) global rule quality and ease of access, rules are grouped in this
repository and should be submitted as pull requests for incorporation.
